I wanted points but itâs not worth anything under 250 when thereâs a 50% chance of 500 so I kept the change around halfway to hopefully maximize my earnings.",Extremely important,Moderately important,Extremely important,I would do about the same except have my second account be the second highest interest rate.,Female,30,Pennsylvania,White,Some college,Non college graduate,Yes,Yes,A great deal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,,8565,700,0,0,,,,,9165,700,0,0,,,,,9865,1903,11768,23.54000092,4.320000172,anaheim12704,,,7334,1,0,0,0,,,,,,3,1,2,1486,1,1,1,0.40000001,0.1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,6485,0,0,0,0,0,900,1500,6485,1,0,0,0,1,1903
